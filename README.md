># <center> Wishlist by Derek </center>

## Project Overview

I often feel lost shopping online, whether that be due to me trying to adhere to a set budget or feeling like 
there are too many items that I want to buy. This application will allow the user to create and keep track of a
*wishlist*. My wishlist will store various items that can be assigned attributes (such as priority, cost, and where to
buy). My hope in creating this application is to ease the stress that comes with online shopping so that everyone can
have a more relaxing time. 

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to **create and add an arbitrary number of items it to a wishlist**
- As a user, I want to be able to delete an item from a wishlist
- As a user, I want to be able to select an item in a wishlist and edit its attributes (name, price, or quantity)
- As a user, I want to be able to sort the items in a wishlist based on their price
- As a user, I want to be able to see the total costs within a wishlist
- As a user, I want to be able to make sure that I can't add items to the wishlist when I've exceeded my budget
- As a user, I want to have the option to either save the wishlist to a file or not when quitting the application
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my wishlist from a file
