># <center> Wishlists by Derek </center>

## Project Overview

I often feel lost shopping online, whether that be due to me trying to adhere to a set budget or feeling like 
there are too many items that I want to buy. This application will allow the user to create and keep track of
*wishlists*. Wishlists will store various items that can be assigned attributes (such as priority, cost, and where to
buy). My hope in creating this application is to ease the stress that comes with online shopping so that everyone can
have a more relaxing time.
